# Solving the puzzle
This laravel project will set up his own word to solve out of the existing wordlist library we created in the Game class.
After starting the project, the game has to guess what word the project picked to be found.

# Variables
Wordlist -> public array[]

# Solution
The solution will be set once the game is started. This solution will be a randomly picked word out of the wordlist array.
